# CFiller
A min-max AI written in C that plays the filler game against you.
### Context
I was bored in a car with a computer and an **annoying** friend that was beating me at the filler game on iMessage.
## Game Rules
![](https://github.com/Hugola/file_upload/blob/master/CFiller/game.png?raw=true) <br>
Each player plays in a corner of the board. Your corner is the bottom left, the AI corner is the top right.
Players take turns filling their corner with one of the color available. The color chosen can't be the color of the opponent tiles.
The game ends when there are only 2 colors on the board.
The winner is the one with the more tiles occupied.
## How to compile it
```
make
```
## How to launch it
```
./try_to_beat_me
```
Good luck ;)
(and yeah my AI is pretty bad, but I still managed to lose against it)
